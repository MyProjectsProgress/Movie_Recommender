# Movie Recommender System

This repository contains a movie recommender system built using machine learning and collaborative filtering techniques. The goal of this project is to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their historical movie preferences and the preferences of similar users.

## Features

- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering:** The recommender system uses collaborative filtering to identify users with similar movie preferences and recommends movies that similar users have enjoyed.

- **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:** It also employs item-based collaborative filtering to suggest movies that are similar to those a user has already rated or liked.

- **Content-Based Recommendations:** In addition to collaborative filtering, the system may incorporate content-based recommendations, considering movie attributes such as genre, director, and actors.

## Data

The system is trained on a dataset of user ratings and movie metadata, which can be easily extended to larger movie databases.

## Getting Started

To get started with the movie recommender system, you can:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies, which may include libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.
3. Preprocess and prepare your movie data and user ratings.
4. Train the recommender system using the provided scripts or Jupyter notebooks.
5. Start making movie recommendations!

## Usage

You can use the trained recommender system to:

- Get personalized movie recommendations for a specific user.
- Recommend similar movies for a given movie.
- Evaluate the performance of the system using metrics like RMSE or MAE.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or suggest improvements. Your input can help make this recommender system even more effective and user-friendly.
